        'Before the events of The Lord of the Rings properly take place, Aragorn traveled widely through Middle-earth, entering the Dwarven mines of Moria via the East-gate of Moria but exiting the same way. He also journeyed to Harad, where (in his own words) "the stars are strange". Tolkien indicated that these travels occurred after TA 2980, but does not indicate what happened during Aragorn\'s visits.',
        'In TA 3009, Gandalf grew suspicious of the origin of the Ring belonging to the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, which later turned out to be the One Ring, the key to the Dark Lord Sauron\'s power. Setting a guard of Rangers on the Shire, Aragorn went at Gandalf\'s request into Rhovanion in search of Gollum, who had once possessed the Ring. He caught the creature in the Dead Marshes near Mordor, and brought him as a captive to Thranduil\'s Halls in Mirkwood, where Gandalf questioned him. Gollum, however, escaped some time later with the aid of Sauron\'s Orcs.',
        'After Frodo left Hobbiton, Gildor Inglorion informed Aragorn that the Nine were looking for him and Gandalf was missing. Aragorn continued to watch the Great East Road until Tom Bombadil and the four hobbits came from the Barrow-downs. Following them to Bree, he met Frodo at the Inn of the Prancing Pony under the name "Strider," as the Men of Bree called him. Though originally the hobbits were suspicious of him, Barliman Butterbur brought a letter from Gandalf that made them trust him. Aragorn was aged 87 at that time, nearing the prime of life for one of royal Númenórean descent.'

        'After the raid on Bree, Aragorn led the Hobbits out of Bree-land and through the Midgewater Marshes. While there, he saw Gandalf\'s battle with the Nazgûl on Weathertop from a distance. When they themselves came to Weathertop, they discovered five of the Nazgûl had followed them, and during the later attack he fought off the Ringwraiths.',
        'After attempting to heal Frodo with athelas, he led them across the Lone-lands towards the Trollshaws. They met with the Elf-lord Glorfindel who led them to the Ford of Bruinen. When the Nazgûl caught up with them and Elrond released a flood, Aragorn and the Hobbits kindled fire and flushed out those Nazgûl that had remained on the western bank. He then accompanied Frodo to Rivendell.',
        ' Amon Sûl (Sindarin), was the southernmost and highest of the Weather Hills in Eriador. It stood a little away from the other hills, and its conical top was flattened. Of old, it formed the boundary between Arthedain and Rhudaur, and upon it was the Tower of Amon Sûl, overlooking the East-West Road. Weathertop\'s summit was almost always windy, due to its prominence.'

      deed: [
        'After Elrond decided that the Ring must be destroyed in Mordor, Frodo took the burden upon himself. There, Aragorn chose to join Frodo, thus forming the Fellowship of the Ring, tasked with accompanying Frodo in destroying the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. Before the group set out, the shards of Narsil were re-forged, and the restored blade was named Andúril.',
        'Rivendell, or Imladris in Sindarin, was the name of an Elven settlement in Eastern Eriador and the valley containing it. Founded by Elrond Half-elven, it was first a stronghold and refuge in the Elves\' first war with Sauron in the Second Age, but in the Third Age became a renowned, peaceful haven for wayward Elves, Rangers of the North, and other travelers. From that time, it was called by some the Last Homely House in the east of the civilized lands of Eriador, or the First Homely House west of the wild lands of Rhovanion over the Misty Mountains.',
        ' Frodo Baggins and his Hobbit companions journeyed to Rivendell, where they met with Bilbo, who had retired there after his eleventy-first birthday. Several other Elves, Dwarves, and Men also arrived in the valley on separate errands. The Fellowship of the Ring was formed, at the close of the decisive Council of Elrond.'
